        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sosina Alofipo, a passionate educator and lifelong learner. I have a deep interest in educational technology and its potential to transform learning experiences. My background spans across curriculum development, instructional design, and digital learning solutions.</p>
        <p>With roots in Pacific Islander culture, I bring a unique perspective to my work in education. I believe in creating inclusive and engaging learning environments that celebrate diversity and promote student success.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working on educational projects, you can find me exploring new music, looking for new places to eat, or enjoying time with my family.</p>
